C++ Practice lesson. The task was to create special function called "mapper" 
which will allow us to fill map in a fancy way:

std::map<int, double> m(mapper(1,1.0)(2,3.3)(3,4.2));

Additional task is to properly handle pointers in this map, 
using std::shared_ptr:

std::map(int, std::shared_ptr<double>> 
	m(mapper(1, new double(2.2))(2, new ...));
